ðŸ“¸ PLACE YOUR BUILDING IMAGE HERE

Your image file should be named: buidling.jpg

Copy it to this folder:
/Users/babarsultan/Documents/personal/al-musawir/public/buidling.jpg

The stunning high-rise building image with evening lighting!

After placing the file:
1. Make sure it's named exactly: buidling.jpg
2. Restart the server: Ctrl+C then npm run dev
3. Hard refresh your browser: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

Troubleshooting:
- Check the filename is exact: buidling.jpg (not building.jpg)
- Check it's in the /public folder
- Try clearing browser cache
- Check browser console for any 404 errors
