# Header & Text Visibility Fixes ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Header Navigation Not in One Line
**Problem:** Menu items were wrapping to multiple lines

**Solutions Applied:**
- ✅ Shortened menu labels (e.g., "About Developer" → "About", "Project Highlights" → "Project")
- ✅ Reduced gap between items from `gap-8` to `gap-6` (with `xl:gap-8` for larger screens)
- ✅ Made text responsive: `text-sm` on large screens, `text-base` on xl screens
- ✅ Added `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent text wrapping
- ✅ Made logo text responsive (hidden on smaller lg screens)

**Result:** All navigation items now fit perfectly in one line!

### 3. ✅ Global CSS Enhancement
**Added new utility class:**
```css
.text-gold-glow {
  text-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(251, 191, 36, 0.5), 
               0 0 40px rgba(251, 191, 36, 0.3);
